        <p class="what-we-do-description">Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this
planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base
Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over
them. We’re proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers
make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides
that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big
climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll
love, too.</p>

        <p class="review-description">Our amazing clients are the reason we exist, and their reactions to our customized
travel experiences and personalized service keep us smiling all day long. Here is just
a sampling of what they’ve said:</p>

        <p class="review-text-1">She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and every aspect
has met, and in most cases exceeded, our expectations. Best prices, best hotels,
best itineraries, and best cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is she
remembers the little things that we would do if we were making the plans ourselves.</p>
        <h2 class="review-person-1">Bertie Norton</h2>
        <p class="review-text-2">Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20 years and
there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I&#39;ve also had great
fun on a few of the group trips she has arranged - Peru &amp; Machu Picchu and a 10-
day cruise out of Venice and diving. It&#39;s always an eclectic group of well traveled,
interesting people.</p>
